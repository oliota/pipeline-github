# Auto Commit Timeline (Final)

This project automates GitHub contributions daily by:

- Creating a branch named after the current date
- Committing a timestamped file
- Opening and automatically closing an issue
- Creating, approving, and merging a pull request

The job runs daily at 12:30 UTC, controlled by environment variables for full flexibility.
